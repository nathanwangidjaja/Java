Encapsulation 
-Advantages:
	- Allows the programmer to hide the classes within the main and allows the user to give access only to a certain code 

Inheritance 
- Disadvantages:
	- Higher time and effort for the program to go through all of the different classes 
	- One of the main disadvantages of this principle would be that the two classes (main and inherited) cannot be utilized freely other than through each other 

Polymorphism
-Advantages:
	- Allows programmers to reuse code and classes when it is already written, tested and used. 
-Disadvantages: 
	- It is difficult for developers to use polymorphjism in codes 
	- It reduces the readability of that given program 

Abstraction
- Disadvantages:
	- Abstract classes in a program cannot be instantiated. However, this itself would not be a significant disadvantage considering that it is not common to create an object of an abstract class
